# My Name is Elliott, come see some of the work I've done!


# Reddit NLP analysis #

  In this project I used reddit's API and chat-gpt responses to build a model to cactch bots!

# Incarceration and it's relation to democracy index #
  - https://github.com/elliottjones56/project_5_group_work
In this project I worked with a group of 3 to generate prediction on US states and latin american countries's democracy index based on their incarceration rate.

# Magic card generation #
  - https://github.com/elliottjones56/capstone/tree/main
FInally in my capstone I used all of the card data of magic the gathering's history to generate the rules text of a magic card with a finetuned gpt-2-simple model and the image from a stable diffusion pipeline.
